# Unilag-Navigation-System
A mini navigation system implemented with Djistra's algorithm. Finds the shortest parts between locations on Campus

Pretty basic.
I simply implemented the Djistra's Algorithm to find the shortest paths between locations.

A basic understanding of Graphs is needed to fullu understand it.


P.S This readme seems to be crappy, please pardon me. I dont normally create Readme files
